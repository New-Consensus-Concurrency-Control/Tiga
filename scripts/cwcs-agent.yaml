# range, interface name, and hostname. Defaults to "0.0.0.0".
# local_ntp_server_address: "0.0.0.0"
#
# The port that the local NTP server listens on. Defaults to 1230.
# local_ntp_server_port: 1230
#
# Log Config
log_config:
  # Directory to save the logs to. Defaults to "/tmp".
  dir: /var/opt/cwcs/log
  #
  # Logging verbosity level (0-9) with 0 as least verbose and 9 as most verbose.

  # also_to_stderr: false
  #
  # Maximum overall log file size in human-readable string
  # (e.g., "1024", "10kB", "5MB", "20 g", "1 tera", or "15 petabyte").
